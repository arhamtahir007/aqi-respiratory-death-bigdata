# AQI & Respiratory Death Rate Analysis (Big Data)

This project analyzes the relationship between **Air Quality Index (AQI)** and **respiratory disease mortality** across U.S. counties using **big data analytics**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – AQI Relation to Respiratory Death Rate
- Level: County-level (FIPS)
- Type: Multi-year environmental & health data

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Dask (Parallel DataFrames)
- Scikit-learn
- Dask-ML
- Power BI (Visualization)
- Tableau (Visualization)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data ingestion using Dask
2. Data cleaning & normalization
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Correlation analysis
5. Regression modeling
6. Random Forest feature importance
7. K-Means clustering
8. County-level aggregation

## 📈 Key Findings
- PM2.5 exposure shows the strongest association with respiratory death rates
- Median AQI alone is a weak predictor of mortality
- Pollutant-specific days are more informative than aggregate AQI
- Machine learning confirms PM2.5 as the dominant feature
- Spatial clustering identifies high-risk counties

## 🌍 SDG Alignment
- **SDG 3:** Good Health and Well-Being
- **SDG 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities
- **SDG 13:** Climate Action

## 📁 Outputs
All processed results are saved as CSV files in the `outputs/` folder.
